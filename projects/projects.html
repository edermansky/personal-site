                    </div>
                    <p> Throughout my senior year of high school I was part of a program called Senior Focus, where I spent a year researching the effect of mass surveillance on abotion access post-Roe. At the end of the year I won an award for the paper I wrote. <br><br>The central question of the project was: <mark>HOW DOES MASS SURVEILLANCE AFFECT THE STATE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AFTER THE FALL OF ROE V. WADE AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PROTECT THEM IN THE FUTURE?</mark>    </p>
